üîπ 1. app.py (Main Application & API)
	‚Ä¢	Acts as the Flask web server and defines API routes for shortening and redirecting URLs.
	‚Ä¢	Handles user requests (e.g., shortens a new URL, redirects users).
	‚Ä¢	Calls functions from database.py to save/retrieve data.
	‚Ä¢	Calls generate_hash() from hashing.py to generate a short URL.

‚úÖ How it interacts with:
	‚Ä¢	database.py ‚Üí Calls functions to store & retrieve URLs.
	‚Ä¢	hashing.py ‚Üí Calls the generate_hash() function to create short URLs.

     2. database.py (Database Management)
	‚Ä¢	Handles all database operations (saving, retrieving, and checking URL mappings).
	‚Ä¢	Manages an SQLite database (urls.db) to store short-long URL pairs.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures data persistence, meaning URLs remain stored even if you restart the app.

‚úÖ How it interacts with:
	‚Ä¢	app.py ‚Üí app.py calls functions from database.py to store and retrieve URL mappings.
	‚Ä¢	Independent ‚Üí It doesn‚Äôt need hashing.py directly; it only deals with database actions.


    üîπ 3. hashing.py (Short URL Generation)
	‚Ä¢	Creates unique short URL hashes for given long URLs.
	‚Ä¢	Uses SHA-256 hashing and trims it down to a shorter, fixed-length string.
	‚Ä¢	Ensures uniqueness by checking with database.py to avoid duplicate short links.

‚úÖ How it interacts with:
	‚Ä¢	app.py ‚Üí app.py calls generate_hash() to create short URLs before saving them in the database.
	‚Ä¢	Does NOT interact with database.py directly, it just returns a hash.

     Full Flow: How Everything Connects

Step-by-Step URL Shortening Process

1Ô∏è‚É£ User sends a POST request to /shorten with a long URL
	‚Ä¢	This request is handled by app.py (Flask server).
	‚Ä¢	app.py extracts the long URL from the request.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Flask calls generate_hash() from hashing.py
	‚Ä¢	The generate_hash() function creates a unique 6-character hash.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Flask calls check_if_alias_exists() from database.py
	‚Ä¢	Ensures that the generated short URL doesn‚Äôt already exist in the database.
	‚Ä¢	If a duplicate exists, a new hash is generated.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Flask calls save_url_mapping() from database.py
	‚Ä¢	Saves the short-long URL pair in the SQLite database.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Flask responds with the shortened URL (http://127.0.0.1:5000/abc123)
	‚Ä¢	The user now has a short URL.

    Step-by-Step URL Redirection Process

1Ô∏è‚É£ User visits http://127.0.0.1:5000/abc123 (the shortened URL)
	‚Ä¢	Flask‚Äôs redirect_to_original(short_url) function in app.py is triggered.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Flask calls get_original_url(short_url) from database.py
	‚Ä¢	Searches the database for the original long URL.

3Ô∏è‚É£ If found, Flask redirects the user to the original URL
	‚Ä¢	If abc123 exists in the database, Flask redirects the user.
	‚Ä¢	If not found, it returns a 404 error.
